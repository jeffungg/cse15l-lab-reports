__Part 1: Debugging Scenario__

  *Background*
   - Students were tasked to create a function that would output the first 10 (Index 0-9) numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence. The output should say `Fibonacci Sequence up to 10 terms: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34`. The students were provided a grade.sh file to run their code on.

   - Correct code to output first 10 numbers of Fibonacci Sequence

  1. Original Post from student
       - Hi! I had a question about my Fibonacci Sequence code. WHen I ran the grade.sh file, I get that the length of my output does not match the length of the actual output. It looks like my code is adding the 11th number to the output. I'm not understanding what I'm doing wrong with my code. I think it'a most likely my for loop but I'm not sure what exactly is causing it to go to the 11th number.
